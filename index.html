            The word democracy comes from the Greek words "demos", 
            meaning people, and "kratos" meaning power; so democracy 
            can be thought of as "power of the people": a way of governing 
            which depends on the will of the people. Strong defines democracy 
            as a system of government in which the majority of the adult 
            population participates in politics on the basis of a representative 
            system. Abraham Lincoln defined democracy as a system of government 
            of the people, by the people, and for the people.
